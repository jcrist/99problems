## 99problems

This problem set has floated around for many different languages:

- [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html)

- [Lisp](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html)

- [Haskell](https://wiki.haskell.org/99_Haskell_exercises)

- [Prolog](https://prof.ti.bfh.ch/hew1/informatik3/prolog/p-99/)

Most of the problems are fairly simple, but seem to provide a good set of tasks
for learning the basics of the language.

I'll be storing my versions here while I learn.
